# Introduction
I was looking for a range slider, with two thumb layers in order to select a more accurate range, when I found this.  It needed some updating, in order to work with iOS 9 and Swift 2.  I took care of those bugs and decided to repost it.


# Installation

## will update later

# Future Work

Currenttly, I'm working on implementing a smooth increment option, where you can slide from values such as 0 - 100000 and set your own increments for each update, such as 1000, 2000, etc.
